NUXT

Nuxt.js is a frontend framework built upon Vue.js that offers great development features
such as server side rendering, automatically generated routes, improved meta tags managing and SEO improvement.


# Client Side Rendering (CSR) vs. Server Side Rendering (SSR)


## BENEFITS OF CSR:

- Dynamically changing page content without having to send a request to the server each time
- The app feels more responsive and users do not see the flash between page navigations due to full-page refreshes
- Fewer HTTP requests are made to the server, as the same assets do not have to be downloaded again for each page load

## DOWNSIDE OF CSR:

- Heavier initial page load due to loading of the framework, app code, and assets required for multiple pages


## BENEFITS OF SSR:

- The initial page of the website load is faster as there are fewer codes to render
- Good for minimal and static sites
- Search engines can crawl the site for better SEO
- Ideal for Static Pages (same HTML codes to all users)

## DOWNSIDE OF SSR:

- The site interactions are less
- Slow page rendering
- Full UI reloads
- Frequent server requests

  # THE SSR PROPERTY

  Change default nuxt ssr value

  Type: boolean
  Default: true

  true: Server-side rendering enabled
  false: No server-side rendering (only client-side rendering)
  You can set this option to false when you want only client side rendering

  nuxt.config.js
  export default {
    ssr: false // Disable Server Side rendering
  }
